# Shopping Assistance System

* The scope of the project is to develop a smart shopping assistant system that helps users optimize their grocery shopping experience by providing recommendations on the most cost- effective and efficient way to procure listed goods.

* The system will focus on supermarkets and groceries as shops within a certain radius of the user's location, and will allow users to search for grocery items online and purchase them physically.

* The project will involve the development of a mobile application and its backend to retrieve and display data. This mobile application will produce output with the assistance of its recommender system.

* This recommender system will include a model for the best path optimization and availability, which will provide the user with the opportunity to purchase items optimally from multiple locations if they are not available in one location.

* The recommender system will also integrate location and mapping information of both the user and shops, as well as seasonal and available offers from the shops.

* Additionally, the system will incorporate a model to show recommendations based on the user's previous searching history and preferences.

* Overall, this smart shopping assistant system will aim to simplify the grocery shopping process for users, while also helping them save time, money, and effort.
